Project title: REST-API-using-Flask-RestX
Link were the app is hosted
Task: Uses two databases to retrieve name of students and course enrollment
Criteria:  list the individual components, use bullet marks.
Creat API endpoints
Deploy application
Test application
Summary: in paragraph form, explain why specific software was used, and what the program should do. Bold the software used
I used Python and VS Code to write the code because this is the backend language that I’m studying.  Then, using VS Code, I installed Flask RestX to create the API, Flask RestX generates a Swagger UI, SQLAlchemy to create the databases. 
Functionality: The user inputs performs a query for a student or course information, modifies the databases (adds and deletes students and/or courses).
Design: explain why the layout of the app was chosen.
Run locally: 
Run this command: git clone https:://…git
Run npm install
Double check your ports …that can usually cause errors
Run npm run start-dev
You are now in the development environment
Tech Stack: use bullet markers to list software used
Python
VS Code
Flask RestX
SQLAlchemy
